    "explanation": "Hypothesis 1 is a probable result of the sentence as it aligns with the actions of the hacker trying to infiltrate the corporation's network. Hypothesis 2, opening a bakery, is very unlikely to be the result of the sentence which is focused on cyberpunk activities and hacking, not on baking.",

    "explanation": "Hypothesis 1 is a probable result of the sentence as uncovering hieroglyphics in a hidden chamber would naturally lead to studying and deciphering them to understand the history. On the other hand, Hypothesis 2, the discovery of a spaceship, is very unlikely as there is no indication or connection in the premise to suggest the presence of advanced technology like a spaceship in an ancient civilization's ruins.",

On the other hand, Hypothesis 2, throwing a party, is very unlikely to be the result of the sentence as it does not align with the dangerous and survival-focused environment described in the premise.",

    "explanation": "Hypothesis 1, the sudden meteor shower is a probable cause of the power outage as meteor showers can cause damage to space stations. Hypothesis 2, crew members practicing yoga on the space station is very unlikely to be the cause of the power outage and subsequent race against time to restore critical systems.",
